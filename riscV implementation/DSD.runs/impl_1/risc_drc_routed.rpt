2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net top_inst/pc/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin top_inst/pc/ImmSel_reg_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell top_inst/pc/ImmSel_reg_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net top_inst/pc/pc_reg_reg[0]_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin top_inst/pc/PC_temp_reg_i_2/O, cell top_inst/pc/PC_temp_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net top_inst/pc/pc_reg_reg[4]_3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin top_inst/pc/MemRW_reg_reg_i_2/O, cell top_inst/pc/MemRW_reg_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
