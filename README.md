This repo is about the single clock microprogrammed Risc_V processor
## WHY RISC_V?
```
1. Open Standard
   - RISC-V is an open and royalty-free ISA.
   - x86 is a proprietary ISA, and manufacturers typically need to license it from Intel or AMD.

2. Customizability
   - RISC-V allows for a high degree of customization in its instruction set.
   - x86 is a more fixed architecture with limited customization options.

3. Modularity
   - RISC-V is designed with modularity, supporting various extensions.
   - x86 has a more complex and less modular architecture.

4. Scalability
   - RISC-V is scalable from low-power embedded systems to high-performance computing.
   - x86 is primarily used in higher-end desktops, servers, and data centers.

5. Ecosystem Growth
   - RISC-V's ecosystem is rapidly growing with support from various industries and academia.
   - x86 has a mature and well-established ecosystem.

6. Lower Power Consumption
   - RISC-V's simplified instruction set and architecture can result in lower power consumption.
   - x86 processors tend to consume more power, which can be a concern for battery-powered devices.

7. Reduced Instruction Set
   - RISC-V follows the RISC philosophy, emphasizing a simpler and streamlined instruction set.
   - x86 has a more complex instruction set due to historical reasons, which can impact power efficiency.

8. Custom Hardware Acceleration
   - RISC-V's open nature allows for the integration of custom hardware accelerators, making it suitable for specialized workloads.
   - x86 also supports custom accelerators but may be more tightly integrated with proprietary technologies.

9. Cost
   - RISC-V can be cost-effective because of its open nature and lack of licensing fees.
   - x86 may involve licensing costs and royalties, which can add to the overall cost of products.
